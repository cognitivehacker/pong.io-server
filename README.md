A Node Server With Socket Io of Pong.io

All changes on server must rebuild with webpack and run node server again, sorry about that.

# Install Dev

1. `docker-compose build`
2. `docker-compose run pong-io-server yarn install`
3. `docker-compose up`
4. `docker-compose run pong-io-server npm start`
